# Team Capture

Team Capture is a Multiplayer first person shooter game inspired by [Quake](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/QUAKE/), [Half-Life 2: Deathmatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/320/HalfLife_2_Deathmatch/), [Team Fortress 2](http://www.teamfortress.com/) and a tf2 mod called [Open Fortress](https://www.openfortress.fun/) (yes, very [Quake engine family](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Quake_-_family_tree.svg) based games).

Team Capture is still in very early development and is developed by a very small team!

Team Capture is built using the [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/) with [our fork](https://github.com/Creepysin-Studios/TC-Mirror) of the [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/) networking system.

# Getting the project

We currently don't offer any pre built builds of the game yet.

You will need to build the project your self!

## Prerequisites

```
Unity 2019.3.3f1
Blender
```

## Pre Setup

Since within the assets of our game we use straight raw Blender files, you will needed to have downloaded and installed [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and to make sure `.blend` files are associated with the Blender program.

## Setup

Once you have Blender ready:

1. Fork and clone the project

2. Open the project up in Unity

## Testing the project

While working on the project, when you go to test your scene or code, remember to start from either the `MainMenu` scene, or from the `Bootstrapper` scene if you want an in-game console.

 of students currently.

**A:** Yes! This game and its source code will be completely free when it comes out.

---

**Q:** Why did you use the Unity game engine? Why not engine *x*?

**A:** We used the Unity game engine because it is C#, and the two members of the team are most familiar with C# and Unity.

**Q:** I can't program or make assets, is there any other way I can support the project?

**A:** If you want to support the project, and you can't make assets, then you can help share the project. Tell your friends, family or hell, even your dog about the project and it can massively help us!
